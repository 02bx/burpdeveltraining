### Overview of the class
In this hands-on class, attendees will learn how to design and develop Burp Suite extensions for a variety of tasks. In eight hours, we work on several plugins to improve manual security testing efforts as well as to create fully-automated security tools. This workshop is based on real-life use cases where the extension capabilities of the tool can be unleashed to improve efficiency and effectiveness of security auditing. As an attendee, you will bring home a full bag of tricks that will take your web security skills to the next level.
### Audience
Suitable for both web application security specialists and developers. Attendees are expected to have rudimental understanding of Burp Suite as well as basic object-oriented programming experience (Burp Extensions will be developed in Java).
### Interested?
We deliver this class during public events (e.g. security conferences) as well as private company workshops. If you're interested in forthcoming public training or you want to know more about private classes, please contact info@doyensec.com
